                    <h4>Microdegree</h4>
                    <p>A Microdegree is a mini training course that someone can undertake online. They can be either free or paid trainings and work very effectively as lead magnets for your online funnels.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="create-degree-middle-item">
                    <h4>Certification</h4>
                    <p>Create a Certification to award a certificate of completion to someone who completes the course. This is ideal if you're training trainers, facilitators, or awarding students with a certificate for completing your course. Certifications should enable the student to 'do' something with what you're teaching. Students will also receive a badge on their profile.</p>

                <div class="create-degree-middle-item">
                    <h4>Microcourse</h4>
                    <p>This is like a Microdegree, except you can schedule the release date of individual steps. Do this if you'd like to release your course over time, or have students take it in cohorts.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="create-degree-middle-item">
                    <h4>Microschool</h4>
                    <p>Microschools allow you to create a whole course and embed existing Microdegrees into the course for students. You can release steps over time, and involve faculty in teaching your Microschool. If you're running a Microschool, you should be teaching the students that enroll - this is more hands-on learning than a Microdegree.</p>

            <p class="popup-create-degree-text">This can take between 7 and 14 days so do account for this time when building.</p>
